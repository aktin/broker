AKTIN Broker 
============
A content-agnostic data exchange middle-ware for federated data warehouses.

This software is not designed for standalone usage. Rather it is to be used within federated
data warehouse environments like e.g. research networks or multi-center clinical study registries 
in conjunction with local workflows and processing infrastructure.

The broker infrastructure contains two main components: The central component `broker-server` is used to publish information to be distributed. The local component `broker-client` is used by multiple parties to retrieve the published information and subsequently report status updates and response-data.

The middleware infrastructure is content-agnostic in the sense that it can be used with 
any format or kind of data. A typical scenario is submitting a query for data extraction (e.g. SQL) to the broker (server) to be received by multiple clients which in turn process the query and return status/progress information and resulting extracted data. Other use cases include distribution of metadata/terminology and processing of material transfer requests.


As all communication is based on RESTful HTTP endpoints, the `broker-client` is optional and can be replaced with simple HTTP calls.


Example for a typical scenario:
```
Analyst          Broker-Server        Broker-Client-1        Broker-Client-2      ....

submit query --->   publish query
                        |
                        |    <-----     ask for queries
                        |                    |
                        |    ----->     receive new query
                        |                    |
                        |    <-----     report status
                        |                    | (internal workflow 
                        |                    | and query execution)
                        |    <-----     report results
                        |
                (collect responses)
                        |
get status update <---  |
                        |
                        |
                        |    <-----------------------------     ask for queries
                        |                                            |
                        |    ----------------------------->     receive new query
                        |                                            |
                        |    <-----------------------------     report status
                        |                                            | (internal workflow 
                        |                                            | and query execution)
                        |    <-----------------------------     report results

```



Getting started
===============
The easiest way to use the software is to download and run the [pre-build binary distribution](../../releases) of  `broker-admin-dist`.

Running the broker
------------------
To run the central broker component, first unpack the binary distribution `broker-admin-dist-1.x.zip`. For running the application, you need a Java 8 runtime environment or newer. We recommend to use the latest OpenJDK version (currently OpenJDK 15). Open a command shell in the extracted folder and run the script `run_broker.sh` for Linux/MingW/GitBash or `run_broker.bat` for Windows respectively. To change startup options (e.g port), edit the startup script.

Running the broker from your IDE for development
------------------------------------------------
To test the broker from an IDE, simply run the class `broker-admin/src/test/java/org.aktin.broker.admin.standalone.TestServer`. The port can be specified as command line argument and defaults to locahost:8080. Running the TestServer (instead of directly using the production `src/main/java/org.aktin.broker.admin.standalone.HttpServer`) will make sure that the system state and configuration files go to the target/ folder instead of cluttering the project directories as well as that example data is already available. In this test environment, the admin password is set to 'test'. Client API-Keys can be found under `broker-admin/src/test/resources/api-keys.properties`. For examples to use the broker, see below.

Building from source code
-------------------------
To build the project from its source code, you need a Java runtime environment (e.g. [OpenJDK 15](https://jdk.java.net/15/), minimum is Java 8) and the build-tool [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). To build the project, download/clone the repository source code and run `mvn clean install` via command shell in the main directory. After the build process is completed, you can find the broker binary distribution in the subfolder `broker-admin-dist/target`. To run the broker, see section *Getting startet* above.



Examples for using the broker
=============================

Below, you will find examples for typical use cases. For accessing the broker from Java/JRE-Applications, you can use the broker-client dependency (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.aktin/broker-client) which communicates with the broker via HTTP. To demonstrate the simplicity of the RESTful API, the command line tool `curl` is used in the following examples for direct HTTP communication.

Submitting a request to the broker
------------------------------
This example performs authentication at the broker and creates a request containing query syntax which is to be distributed to all nodes.
```bash
# Admin authentication and store token in shell variable
TOKEN=`curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -X POST \
    -d '<credentials><username>admin</username><password>CHANGEME</password></credentials>' \
    http://localhost:8080/auth/login`

# Create a file containing the query syntax
echo "SELECT * FROM fhir_observation" > query1.sql

# submit the query
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/sql" -X POST \
     -d @query1.sql http://localhost:8080/broker/request

# the response will contain a Location header for the newly created request. 
# We will use this location below to publish the request
curl -si -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST http://localhost:8080/broker/request/1/publish

```
Documentation on the RESTful API of the request administration endpoint can be found in [RequestAdminEndpoint.java](broker-server/src/main/java/org/aktin/broker/RequestAdminEndpoint.java)


Retrieving a request at the client side
---------------------------------------
In this example, the client will authenticate via API-key and receives the published request.
```bash
# list available requests
curl -is -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey123" http://localhost:8080/broker/my/request

# retrieve first request
curl -is -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey123" http://localhost:8080/broker/my/request/1

# update status to retrieved
curl -is -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey123" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/broker/my/request/1/status/retrieved
```

Supplying results to a request from the client side
---------------------------------------------------
This example demonstrates, how the client can supply arbitrary data as a result to a request.
```bash
# Create a file containing the query results
echo -e "a;b\n1;2\n3;4\n" > result1.csv

# submit the file contents
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey123" -H "Content-Type: text/csv" -X PUT \
     -d @result1.csv http://localhost:8080/aggregator/my/request/1/result

# update status to completed
curl -is -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey123" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/broker/my/request/1/status/completed

```



Updating the client status for a request
----------------------------------------
A different client may also reject a query. (Note the different API-key to indicate a different client)
```
curl -is -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey567" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/broker/my/request/1/status/rejected
```
Possible request states are documented in [broker-api/RequestStatus](broker-api/src/main/java/org/aktin/broker/xml/RequestStatus.java)



Download the collection of results for a query
----------------------------------------------
Once one or more clients have responded to a request e.g. by supplying result data,
the submitter can retrieve the results either via individual REST calls or more conveniently
via ZIP bundle:

```bash
# assuming authentication was already done (see first example)
# retrieve a download ID for the bundle containing all results and status updates
BUNDLE_ID=`curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"  http://localhost:8080/broker/export/request-bundle/1`

# download the results bundle
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --output results.zip \
     http://localhost:8080/broker/download/$BUNDLE_ID 

```


Using the web frontend
----------------------
The broker includes a minimal web frontent, which can be used to view the status of connected nodes,
manage requests and responses and download results. This frontent serves only as a built-in minimal 
user interface - for a better user experience, external customized frontents should be used.

To access the frontend, go to http://localhost:8080/admin/html/index.html once the broker is running.
For login, use the username *admin*. The admin password is specified in the startup script and defaults to *CHANGEME*.

The minimal web frontend currently only supports the `org.aktin.broker.auth.cred.CredentialTokenAuthProvider`. 
Without this auth provider, the frontend will not function. Nevertheless, the broker will be fully function


Using the broker-client library
-------------------------------
To use broker functionality in java client applications, you can use the broker-client dependency 
(https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.aktin/broker-client).

The client library comes with two runnable implementations:
1. `org.aktin.broker.client.live.sysproc.CLI` for a command line implementation with executes custom OS processes to automatically handle requests.
2. `org.aktin.broker.client.live.util.AdminListener` which connects to the server and listens/prints any changes and updates.
For more information, see broker-client/README.md


For a code example of other clients, see
the following implementations:
- https://github.com/li2b2/li2b2-shrine/tree/master/node/i2b2/i2b2-node
- https://github.com/li2b2/li2b2-shrine/tree/master/node/dktk/dktk-node


Publishing node resources to the broker (eg. statistics, health status, etc.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A node can publish and update arbitrary resources to the broker. This functionality
is commonly used to upload daily statistics, ETL errors or health information.
```bash

# Create a file containing some health info
date > health.txt
free >> health.txt
df -lh / >> health.txt

curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxApiKey123" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -X PUT \
     -d @health.txt http://localhost:8080/broker/my/node/health

```
The last part of the URL `/broker/my/node/health` can be changed to any other name eg., `/broker/my/node/stats`.

If someone with admin-privilege is connected to the broker via websocket, they will receive a realtime notification `resource update 0 health`.

On the admin side, the node resource can be downloaded via 
```
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxAdmin1234" --output health-0.txt \
     http://localhost:8080/broker/node/0/health
```

Real-time communication via websocket connection
================================================

For non-real-time applications, the node/client is typically configured 
to ask (poll) for new requests in pre-defined intervals. In this case, 
only short-lived HTTPS connections are used from client to server.

For real-time applications, each node needs to be notified immediately 
about new requests. For this purpose, websocket connections can be used:

A websocket connection is established from node to broker and kept open. 
Over this connection, the broker will send a notification once a new 
request is published or an existing request is closed. 
See [MyBrokerWebsocket.java](broker-server/src/main/java/org/aktin/broker/websocket/MyBrokerWebsocket.java)

When such a notification is retrieved by the client, it will react immediately by retrieving and processing the request.

The websocket is only used for notifications and optional ping-pong messages.
All content and status updates are transferred via traditional HTTPS connections initiated by the client as explained above.



Using other authentication methods and authentication providers
===============================================================

Multiple authentication/authorization providers are supported.
Default method is API key authentication.

OpenConnect, OAuth, KeyCloak
----------------------------

Client now retrieves keycloak token. Broker does no longer use the introspection endpoint but checks the token itself.

To get it running, the following is needed:

keycloak.json: get it from keycloak. Go to your client there, and click on the "installation" tab and select "keycloak oidc json" 
format. Copy the file to the target folder (where sysproc.properties is copied to as well)
add the OpenIdAuthProvider to the list of providers. 

In run_broker.sh, add `-Dbroker.auth.provider=org.aktin.broker.auth.apikey.ApiKeyPropertiesAuthProvider,org.aktin.broker.auth.cred.CredentialTokenAuthProvider,org.aktin.broker.auth.openid.OpenIdAuthProvider` or if wanted, add it to the defaultconfig
adapt openid-config.properties (broker-admin) to contain the correct urls to your keycloak and copy 
it to the place where you extracted the broker admin dist zip to (place it where api-keys.properties is)
